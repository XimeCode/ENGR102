#Part #1:

x1 = 10
y1 = 2029
x2 = 55
y2 = 23029
x0=25
#x0 = Time (25)


slope = float((y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1))
print(float(slope))

#set two expressions for the slope equal to each other
# when time = 25
# y = (slope)(x-x1)+y1
position = (float((slope) * (x0 - x1)) + y1)
print(position)

#print time and position with a line describing what is being output
print ("Part 1:")
print ("For t = 25 minutes, the position p =", position ,"kilometers")



#PART #2:

# distance from houston 
# radius = 6745 km
# every time ISS passes houston distance is reset to zero

import math 

#caculate the total distance around the circle the ISS travels 
radius = 6745
circumfrence = 2 * math.pi * 6745

t1 = 10
k1 = 2029
t2 = 55
k2 = 23029

#every time the ISS passes directly over Houston, the distance resets to 0
#k0 = when ISS has not reached houston yet meaning time = 0 (behind houston)

k0 = 2029 - (slope) * 10 
time = 300 

#calculate the position away from houston at any time 

total_travel = (slope * (time) + k0)

actual_travel = total_travel % circumfrence

print (actual_travel)
print ("Part 2:")
print ("For t = 300 minutes, the position p =", actual_travel ,"kilometers")
